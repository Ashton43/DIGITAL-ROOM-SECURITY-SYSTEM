# ROOM-SECUTIRY-AND-AUTOMATION-SYSTEM

THIS IS A MULTISIM PROJECT FOCUSED ON DIGITAL ROOM SECURITY. ADDITIONAL MINI FEATURES INCLUDE AUTOMATIC LIGHTING AND TURNING ON OF AC.


There's "Digital Lock" on the door of the room. To enter the room someone must enter 5 digit pin.
The lock takes only binary numbers as pin. If 5 digit pin is correctly given then the door is unlocked.
Inside the room there's a "Motion detector". If the motion detector detects any movement then "Light bulb" will turn on and also checks room temperature. If room temperature is high then "Air condition" is also turned on.
