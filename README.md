# ROOM-SECUTIRY-AND-AUTOMATION-SYSTEM

THIS IS A MULTISIM PROJECT FOCUSED ON DIGITAL ROOM SECURITY.


There's "Digital Lock" on the door of the room. To enter the room someone must enter 5 digit pin.
The lock takes only binary numbers as pin. If 5 digit pin is correctly given then the door is unlocked.
You have 3 attempts else ALARM goes off.
